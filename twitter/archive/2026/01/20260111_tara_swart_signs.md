## The Post

Dr. Tara Swart is a neuroscientist who wrote a book called The Signs about intuition and pattern recognition.

Her core claim: what we call "signs from the universe" are products of attention, emotional salience, and pattern recognition in the brain.

Not magic. Not supernatural. Neural mechanisms.

The key is the ARAS—the ascending reticular activating system. It's a filter in your brainstem that decides which sensory inputs reach conscious awareness.

When something is emotionally important or currently on your mind, the ARAS biases attention toward related stimuli.

Suddenly you see robins everywhere. Or that number keeps appearing. Or the same phrase shows up three times in a day.

It feels like the universe is speaking.

Swart's reframe: your brain is highlighting patterns that match your emotional needs, using very real neural filters.

This doesn't diminish the experience. It explains why it feels meaningful.

The mechanism:
- Intention and emotional charge "tune" your attention filter
- Matching patterns pop into awareness
- The brain flags them as salient
- You notice and remember them

"Signs" are real—as pattern perception. Not mystical transmission. Natural mechanism.

She also connects this to intuition: rapid, often unconscious integration of stored knowledge, emotional memory, and bodily cues. Gut feelings and "truth bumps" are interoceptive signals feeding into brain decision systems.

The implication: practices that restore sensitivity to inner signals—journaling, meditation, time in nature—strengthen the neural pathways that support intuitive recognition.

You can train pattern perception.

This is the kind of work that matters: taking experiences people frame spiritually and providing naturalistic grounding without dismissing the experience as "just in your head."

It's both. It's in your head AND it's real. The brain's pattern perception is a genuine capability perceiving genuine structure.
