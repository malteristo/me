## The Post

What if instead of integrating AI into your workflow... you gave the workflow to the AI?

Traditional automation forces humans to think like machines. Steps, conditionals, rigid sequences.

Flip it. Describe the goal. Let the AI become the solver—not a step, but the engine.

When workflows break, they fail. When flows encounter variance, they adapt.

Flows learn. Each execution captures wisdom. The next run is smarter.

Progressive disclosure: Start with just the goal. Add detail only where you want control.
