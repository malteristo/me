## The Post

Marie-Louise von Franz studied fairy tales for decades with Carl Jung.

She found that wisdom is contradictory.

For every tale that says fight, another says flee. For every lesson that works, another contradicts it.

She called this the Rule of Contradiction.

At first it bothered her. Then she realized: the contradiction is the point.

If there were one right answer, there'd be no individuals—just followers. Individuality emerges precisely from choosing between contradictions.

But here's the strange part.

Across all cultures, all nations, all of history, she found one rule that no fairy tale ever contradicts:

Never hurt the helpful animal.

In stories, when the hero is lost, an animal appears and offers guidance. The hero who trusts it succeeds. The hero who betrays it fails. Every time. No exceptions.

The helpful animal is your conscience. Your inner compass. The voice that knows before you can explain why.

And Jung warned: the false conscience feels identical to the true one.

Both feel urgent. Both feel right. Both demand action.

The difference is speed.

The false conscience creates pressure. Decide now. Act now. No time to think.

The true conscience can wait. It deepens when you slow down. It becomes clearer with time, not more urgent.

So the practice is simple:

When you feel compelled to decide immediately—pause. The answer that remains after the urgency fades is more likely to be true.

Wisdom is contradictory. But this one rule isn't.

Never hurt the helpful animal.
