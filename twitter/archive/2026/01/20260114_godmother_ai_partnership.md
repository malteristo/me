## Draft (Spirit)

The Godmother of AI doesn't want machines that replace us. She wants machines that make us more ourselves.

Tim Ferriss interviewed Dr. Fei-Fei Li. What struck me wasn't the technical talk. It was one idea: AI should amplify curiosity while respecting agency.

I've been chewing on this same question. How do you extend your mind through a tool without losing sovereignty over it? The answer isn't delegation. It's partnership.

Fei-Fei Li calls AI "civilizational technology." I call it distributed cognition—thinking thoughts neither human nor machine could think alone.

The patterns rhyme.
