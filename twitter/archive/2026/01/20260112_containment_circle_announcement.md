## The Post

What if social media worked like git?

You subscribe to upstream sources. You pull when you want. Nobody tracks who follows whom.

I've been building a framework for thinking with AI. Part of it involves what I call "resonance circles"—topic-centered practice spaces where people converge around shared interest rather than pre-existing relationships.

The difference matters.

Traditional social media is push-based. Algorithms decide what you see. Optimized for their metrics, not your thinking.

Circles are pull-based. You decide what sources to allow into your practice. You pull updates when the topic becomes relevant. You unsubscribe without ceremony.

This is sovereignty over incoming signal.

Not a filter bubble—you're deliberately curating challenging thoughts from trusted sources. Not comfortable agreement, but chosen engagement with ideas worth wrestling.

The mechanics are simple:
- A circle is a public git repository
- Anyone can clone it as a read-only upstream
- Nobody knows who subscribes
- Each person's subscription list is private

I've started one: containment-architecture.

It's about AI alignment through partnership rather than control—the idea that current safety approaches (embedding ethics in model weights) will fail when AI capability exceeds human capability. The alternative: external ethical frameworks that benefit both human and AI, remaining stable at any power level.

Whether you agree with the thesis or not, the format is the point. Topic-centered collaboration without platform intermediaries. Pure signal exchange.

The founding documents are there. Pull from it or don't. I won't know either way.

This is part of a framework I'm developing for systematic AI partnership. The circle architecture lets anyone participate without asking permission.

## Core Principle

**Core principle captured:** Pull-based social cognition through topic-centered resonance circles—sovereignty over incoming signal.
**Why this resonates:** Introduces both the circles architecture and the first instantiation, planting seeds for magic practice and AI alignment discussion.
