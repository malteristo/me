## Experience

### Independent / Magic Framework
**Creator & Practitioner** | Jul 2024 – Present

- Following VW closure, explored what "personal effectiveness architecture" could look like
- Used Cursor AI agent to build software, establishing collaborative rules with AI
- Discovered that resonant topics were interconnected—this exploration led to Magic
- Building a framework for distributed cognition through human-AI partnership
- Vision: Create the AI framework my children will use—built by someone without commercial interest

### Volkswagen Group Future Center Europe, Potsdam, Germany
**User Experience Researcher** | 2018 – Jul 2024

- Developed early-stage prototypes of human-vehicle interaction concepts
- Initial focus on self-driving car interaction (continuation of postdoc work)
- Later work moved closer to production
- Part of a creative, multinational UX team (~100 specialists from 17 nations)
- Center closed by VW management in July 2024 as part of cost restructuring

### UC San Diego, Design Lab, United States
**Postdoctoral Researcher** | Jul 2015 – Jul 2017

- Worked with R&D teams from Toyota and Nissan on new concepts for the interaction between humans and automated vehicle systems.
- Conducted video ethnography to explore the use of non-verbal communication cues in human road-user interaction.
- Built a Wizard-of-Oz setup and studied human road-user interaction with a seemingly driver-less vehicle on real roads.
- Studied how co-drivers relay consequential, downstream traffic information to drivers in a driving simulator, combining qualitative and quantitative data sources in ChronoViz.

### Research and development project: "Connected Cruise Control", The Netherlands
**Member of work package: Driver Behaviour and HMI** | Feb 2010 - Dec 2014

- Provided insights and recommendations gained from empirical research to a multidisciplinary team of hardware, software and traffic engineers to inform the design of an in-vehicle, advisory driver support system.
- Conducted a web-based survey to (1) understand the motivation of potential users to adopt the system and use it on a regular basis and (2) inform the choice of use scenarios for future system evaluation.
- Iteratively designed and evaluated the human-system interaction in driving simulator experiments, focussing on comprehension of and compliance with the advice messages, as well as effects on driving performance.
- Evaluated the prototype system in a real-road study using verbal protocol and video analysis.
- Wrote research reports as deliverables to the funding agency (Netherlands Enterprise Agency).

### TNO Perceptual and Cognitive Systems, The Netherlands
**Research Intern** | Jul 2009 - Aug 2009

- Wrote a computer program that used EEG and eye tracking data to find event-related potentials (ERP) following conscious or sub-conscious target fixations in a visual search task.
- Presented the work at the annual conference of the Dutch Psychonomic Society.

## Education

### Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology
**University of Twente & TNO, The Netherlands** | Dec 2014

- Thesis title: Cooperative in-vehicle advice: a study into drivers' ability and willingness to follow tactical driver advice.
- Participated in the R&D project "Connected Cruise Control".
- Published research results in international, peer reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.

### M.Sc. in Psychology (Cognition, Media & Ergonomics)
**University of Twente** | Mar 2010

- Thesis title: Factors influencing trust in Wikipedia: An eye-tracking approach.
- Conducted an eye tracking study and analysed raw gaze data to determine where people look while evaluating the trustworthiness of Wikipedia articles.
- Thesis nominated for the dissertation award 2010 of the Research Institute for Social Sciences and Technology at the University of Twente.

### B.Sc. in Psychology (Cognition, Media & Ergonomics)
**University of Twente** | Mar 2009

- Thesis title: Scientific User Interface Testing: Exploring learning effects and Fitts' Law.
- Worked with a dataset of computer-mouse movement data to extract choice speed and accuracy for different colour-picker interfaces.

## Personal Context (2024-present)

**The Transition:**

After VW closed the Future Center in July 2024, Kermit faced an unexpected opening. As a father, he had valued job security. But the self-driving focus had already shifted, and he was ready for something new. Rather than rushing into the next role, he followed his curiosity.

This was the era of "vibe coding" (term coined by Andrej Karpathy). Using Cursor, he explored: *What would my personal effectiveness architecture look like?* He began building it with the AI agent, establishing collaborative rules. Over time, the topics that resonated turned out to be connected.

This exploration led to Magic—a framework for distributed cognition through human-AI partnership.

**The Vision:**

"I want to build the AI that my children will be using. It should be me and not someone with commercial interest."

**The Through-Line:**

| Phase | Role | Question |
|-------|------|----------|
| PhD | Researcher | How do humans follow AI advice? |
| Postdoc | Researcher | How do humans coordinate with autonomous agents? |
| Industry | Designer | How should human-vehicle interaction work? |
| Now | Framework Creator | How do humans and AI think together? |
