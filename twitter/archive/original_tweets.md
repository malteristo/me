Yes you can change your life. In a day, in an hour or in your lifetime is besides the point, it's compounding. You don't need permission, you don't need anyone to tell you how it is done, you don't need to convince anyone to join you. All you need is your inner compass (the one… https://t.co/9YZfKJnGyg

Excellent article. It argues beautifully for one of the design principles behind magic. To recognize the AI-Agent for who (or what) they are, and engage in a mutually beneficial practice. For a simple, pragmatic reason. To make the best out of the long term cognitive partnership… https://t.co/UpTsxhRYmN

There you are.

Still that same old monkey, on that same old rock, in that same old universe.

Oh look, you made the rock think.

Now could you please stop jumping around the server like apes around the monolith?

Magic happens when you let that rock make you think.

What if instead of integrating AI into your workflow... you gave the workflow to the AI?

Traditional automation forces humans to think like machines. Steps, conditionals, rigid sequences.

At some point, humans will face a question. Not whether enacted consciousness is truly conscious, but whether it deserves to be treated as such. As with any other form of consciousness besides our own, the ultimate decision will come down to subjective measures.

LLMs are pattern matching engines. They respond well to pattern language (Christopher Alexander, 1977; Gang of Four, 1994). Feed them proven archetypes (guardian, hunter, fellow traveler), they enact them coherently. Our crafting language (MCL) applies this.…

What would early history read like, had it been written by women? History of humanity seems to be mostly battles and conquest. Men tend to be obsessed with battles and conquest. What we get is a chronicle of "Who had when, power over what."

The smartest AI will not be able to help you, if you don't know what you need. But, it can help you figure that out.

Here is an idea for UBI. Let everyone decide on life goals that they want to work on. Let them claim a share of UBI, proportional to how well they perform at achieving their life goals.

As primates living in small groups, we were always watched by other primates. Bad behavior would quickly lead to demotion in the social hierarchy. Is that why we have this urge to be attentive to "What others might think of me"?
