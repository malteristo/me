# Circles

*Topics I contribute thinking to*

---

Circles are spaces for shared thinking around specific topics. This page lists the public circles I participate in—areas where I'm actively developing and sharing ideas.

## Active Circles

### Containment Architecture

**Topic:** AI alignment through partnership architecture

**Status:** Forming

**Core thesis:** The only AI alignment architecture that scales is one where power flows upward from individuals, not downward from institutions. Align AI to the individual first. Then connect aligned individuals to align on shared goals.

**Repository:** [containment-architecture](https://github.com/malteristo/containment-architecture)

**Key documents:**
- On the Containment Architecture
- On Testing Resonance Keys

## Topics I Think About

Beyond formal circles, these are the themes that run through my public thinking:

| Theme | What I'm Exploring |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Distributed Cognition** | How humans and AI think together as a cognitive unit |
| **Cognitive Sovereignty** | Shaping the conditions that shape your thinking |
| **The Pattern** | Discoverable structure that independent observers converge on |
| **Meaning Crisis** | Finding meaning in a world where old sources are declining |
| **Inner Compass** | The intuitive knowing that whispers which path is right |

## Invitations

If any of these topics resonate, I welcome collaboration.

The circles are open. The practice is shared.
