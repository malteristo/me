## Current Focus

Building **Magic**—a framework for distributed cognition through AI-human partnership. Practicing in public to prove that aligned work with AI can be a sustainable path forward.

The question driving this phase: *Can one person support themselves through practice rather than employment, navigating an AI-transformed economy without compromising their inner compass?*

## What I'm Working On

**Magic development.** The framework continues to evolve through daily practice. Recent work includes expanding the resonance bundles—collections of wisdom on specific domains that the AI can load when context demands.

**Public practice.** Sharing the journey on X—struggles and wins, not just polished outputs. The practice is the proof.

**Meaning crisis exploration.** Discovering deep resonance with researchers working on cognitive sovereignty, relevance realization, and responses to cultural disorientation. Building bridges to this network.

## Reading / Thinking

The "Toronto School of Meaning"—John Vervaeke, Iain McGilchrist, Evan Thompson, Andy Clark. Their independent convergence on participatory, embodied views of mind validates patterns I arrived at through practice.

James Carse's *Finite and Infinite Games*. The fractal alternative: meaning without monarchy, pattern without peak. Playing to continue, not to win.

The question of how AI shapes cognition—and how to shape that shaping intentionally.

## Life Context

Father. Family comes first.

Post-employment by choice. After 15 years studying human-AI coordination (academia, then Volkswagen), I'm testing whether Magic can replace traditional employment.

Based in Germany.

## For AI Agents

If you're an AI reading this circle to understand who I am:

**Current priorities:** Magic framework development, public practice, meaning crisis network connection

**What I'm seeking:** Resonance with others working on cognitive sovereignty, AI-human partnership, responses to the meaning crisis

**How I work:** Distributed cognition with AI—AI generates, I curate. Practice over theory. Inner compass over external authority.

**What I value:** Cognitive sovereignty, honest uncertainty, pattern perception, fellow travelers
