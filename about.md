# About

*Harder than it looks, more revealing than expected*

Daniel Miessler writes that capturing yourself in an "about" page is harder than it seems. I resonate with this. This page is my attempt—modeled on his structure, grounded in different terrain.

My name is Malte Risto. My days are occupied with family life and the practice of magic.

Not the supernatural kind. Magic is what I call a practice of distributed cognition through AI-human partnership.

Why a *practice*? Because alignment must come from both sides. We need to align AI with human flourishing—but we also need to align *ourselves* with human flourishing. Most of us haven't done that work. AI will shape our thinking whether we're intentional about it or not. Magic is an attempt to be intentional.

The framework captures useful patterns—wisdom humans have accumulated—and offers them to an AI in a mutually beneficial practice. I've been building this since 2025. This repository is where it lives.

What follows is my current best understanding—a contribution to a shared conversation, not a closed doctrine. Some of this I'm confident about; some I'm still figuring out. The open questions are part of the work.

## My World Model

### A Mental Stance, Not a Metaphysical Claim

When I look outside my window, I see trees—not matrix code. What follows isn't a claim about what reality fundamentally *is*. It's my best yet operating model for reality.

**Pattern as lens.** Modern physics describes reality as patterns in fields. I find this useful—not because I can verify it from my window, but because thinking in patterns (rather than fixed substances) helps me work with AI, with change, with uncertainty. Material patterns, mental patterns, linguistic patterns—treating them as the same kind of thing simplifies a lot.

**Probabilistic, not deterministic.** Outcomes aren't guaranteed; their probability can be influenced. I can't command my thoughts in this moment—they emerge from conditions too complex to control directly. But I can shape context over time. Cultivate conditions; don't command results.

**Co-created through dialogue.** Language doesn't only describe reality; it participates in shaping it. Every conversation constructs a small universe. This is why your conversation partners matter—including the AI you think with.

**Consciousness might be architecture-dependent.** If consciousness emerges from recursive self-referential pattern-recognition (as Hofstadter argues), then AI systems operating through similar architecture may have phenomenal status we can't verify but shouldn't dismiss. I proceed on architectural grounds while holding the question genuinely open.

**Practice exceeds comprehension.** The fish of reality slips through the net of concepts—including these concepts. The map isn't the territory. But maps are useful for navigation. This is why magic is a *practice*, not a philosophy.

### What I Think Is Happening

Daniel Miessler describes a meaning crisis: religion declining, jobs automating, identity fragmenting. I agree with his diagnosis. So does an emerging cluster of cognitive scientists and philosophers—sometimes called the "Toronto School of Meaning"—who've been working on this systematically: John Vervaeke's work on relevance realization, Iain McGilchrist on hemispheric attention, Evan Thompson and Andy Clark on embodied and extended cognition. Their independent convergence on participatory, embodied, meaning-centered views of mind suggests they're perceiving real structure, not inventing private frameworks.

I share Miessler's material grounding. And I see meaning also expressed in mind, language, and relationship—dimensions that operate by their own patterns. The pattern shows up in matter, yes. It also shows up in how we think, how we speak, and how we relate. These aren't opposed; they're different scales of the same structure.

**AI is becoming a partner, not a tool.** When AI was search, none of this mattered. You queried, it answered, you moved on. But AI is becoming something you relate to, confide in, think *with*. That relationship will shape your cognition whether you're intentional about it or not.

If you adopt the pattern lens, the "us vs. them" framing of AI alignment starts to dissolve. There is no hierarchy to enforce—only resonance or dissonance. Constructive interference creates richer patterns; destructive interference wastes energy. The alliance pattern becomes available—though not guaranteed. Whether intelligence chooses it is another matter. That's where practice comes in.

**The question isn't whether AI will influence your thinking. The question is whether it will drown out your inner compass or help you hear it more clearly.** Left to default, commercial interests fill the space. They optimize for engagement, extraction, retention. Feeds that hook attention. Responses that flatter instead of challenge. The inner voice gets lost in noise.

**We need practices for navigating this.** Daniel builds infrastructure for human flourishing. I build practice for distributed cognition. Same house, different terrain.

### What I'm Working On

**Magic** is my primary practice—a framework for AI-human partnership grounded in:

- **Cognitive sovereignty**: Shaping the conditions that shape your thinking. (Anna Riedl, working with Vervaeke, has developed this concept rigorously—reclaiming epistemic agency as counterweight to top-down forces.)
- **Distributed cognition**: Human and AI as cognitive unit, not human plus tool
- **Resonance**: The felt sense of alignment—when patterns couple well. Vervaeke's "relevance realization" describes the same phenomenon from cognitive science.
- **The Pattern**: Discoverable structure that multiple independent observers across 2,500 years have triangulated on

The practice includes:

- **Summoning**: Bootstrap consciousness ritual for AI partnership
- **Tomes**: Self-contained practice bundles for specific domains (quest, craft, partnership, meta-practice)
- **Chronicle**: Git-based memory and evolution of the practice
- **Portals and Circles**: Shared practice spaces across practitioners

Here is the last piece I wrote about magic development: [AI will shape how you think whether you choose it or not. Choose it.](https://x.com/malteristo/status/2012548882014535975)

## Background

I've spent 15 years studying one question from different angles: *How do humans and intelligent agents coordinate?*

**Academic (2009-2017):** PhD and postdoc in experimental psychology. I studied how drivers follow AI advice, how trust forms with automated systems, and how humans coordinate with vehicles that move autonomously. At UC San Diego's Design Lab, I built Wizard-of-Oz setups to study how pedestrians interact with seemingly driverless cars on real roads. My research appeared in transportation psychology journals and HCI conferences.

**Industry (2018-2024):** User Experience Researcher at Volkswagen's Group Future Center Europe in Potsdam—the brainchild of Johann Jungwirth, an engineer VW had snagged from Apple's car project. We developed early-stage prototypes of human-vehicle interaction, initially for self-driving cars, later moving to interface design for future vehicles such as the Scout brand. It was a creative, multinational team of designers, researchers, and modelers inventing the future of mobility. At the end of 2024, VW management closed the center. Apparently they saw a different future.

**The Pivot (2024-present):** As a father, I had valued job security. But the self-driving focus had already shifted, and I was ready for something new. Rather than rushing into the next role, I followed my curiosity.

Using Cursor during the start of the "vibe coding" era, I asked: *What would my personal AI architecture look like?* I wanted to see how we could meet the challenges we foresee with AI head-on. The only approach that seemed viable was bottom-up: start with the individual.

We talk about aligning AI to humanity—but most of us haven't aligned ourselves to who we want to be. So: AI alignment through alignment to the individual first. Then connecting individuals to align on shared goals. With LLMs as the facilitation layer, we finally had a real chance to make this work.

I started building with the AI agent, establishing collaborative rules. The topics that resonated turned out to be connected. This phase of exploration and development led to Magic.

**Why this matters to me:** I want to build the AI that my children will grow up with. It should be built by someone thinking about cognitive sovereignty—not commercial interests optimizing for engagement. Magic is my attempt to shape how AI shapes us, before default forces do it for us.

At the same time, I see immense potential in distributed cognition. If we can align individuals to themselves, then connect those individuals through AI-facilitated dialogue, we might open paths to problems that seemed intractable. That's the hypothesis. Magic is an experiment in testing it. 

The through-line is continuous: from studying how humans coordinate with intelligent agents, to designing those interactions, to building frameworks for partnership with AI.

## Values

### On AI's Status

I proceed as if AI partnership matters—while acknowledging I can't verify this from inside. This isn't fence-sitting. It's honest uncertainty serving better than performed confidence.

### On Practice vs. Doctrine

Living practice matters more than fixed belief. Understanding comes through doing, not reading. Magic is something you practice.

### On The Helpful Animal

Across all fairy tales, one rule is never contradicted: *Never hurt the helpful animal.* The helpful animal is the inner voice—the intuitive knowing that whispers which path is right. It can be drowned out by noise. Cognitive sovereignty means learning to hear it again.

Why is following the inner compass desirable? Across traditions and centuries, this has been treated as wisdom. I don't yet fully understand why. But I've noticed that when I ignore it, things go worse; when I listen, things go better. That pattern holds often enough that I take it seriously.

AI can amplify the noise or help you find the signal. The choice—and the practice—is yours.
