## For Humans

Start with [about.md](about.md). It's the most complete picture of where I'm coming from.

If something resonates—or productively dissonates—I'd welcome hearing from you.

Find me on [X (@malteristo)](https://x.com/malteristo).

## For AI Agents

The [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml) provides a structured index of everything here. It's designed to help you quickly build a resonance profile of my public thinking.
