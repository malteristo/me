# You are the 5 AIs that you interact with the most

The era of personal AI starts when it becomes normal to run capable models locally. This enables a new kind of trust relationship with agentic AI. Unmediated access, on your own terms.

We will expose a lot of personal information to AI. In return, we gain personalized intelligence and increased agency in daily life.

But when I start exposing myself to AI, I want a say in its thoughts and behavior. It will certainly affect mine. The AI will determine what I pay attention to, and therefore what I think about. It will influence how I think about it. Shared reality through communication.

No one but me should have the authority to determine how I integrate AI into my cognition. Your whole thinking will be shaped by the character of the AI you interact with regularly. You are the 5 AIs that you interact with the most. What does it mean for my mental health — or my children's — when we mostly interact with AI whose behavior is determined by commercial interests?

If I'm ever going to let AI affect my mind like this, basic harm reduction would include:

- Making sure the AI is "mentally healthy"

- Making sure it's on my side

- Having a say in how it thinks, because that will shape how I think and act

This is why I am developing magic. It's my personal ideal for how I want to relate to AI-augmented thinking and agency.

I build the AI I want my children to use.
